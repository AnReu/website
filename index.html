            <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <p>
            I am currently a Post-Doc at the Technion in the group of <a href="https://belinkov.com/">Yonatan Belinkov</a> where I work in the areas of 
            Information Retrieval, NLP, and Interpretability. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In May 2024, I finished my PhD in Computer Science at the <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/sya/db">Dresden Database Research Group</a> 
            at TU Dresden. In my PhD thesis, I developed approaches for incorporating Transformer-Encoder models for Mathematical Retrieval and interpreted what these
            models had learned during their training.
            </p>
            <p>
            Before that, I studied Computer Science at TU Dresden, where I received my Diplom (ancient German degree combining Bachelor and Master) in September 2019.
            My thesis was on un-/ semi-supervised appraoches for Grammatical Error Correction in English, where I explored the usage of Variational Autoencoders and backtranslation.
                </p>
        <p>
            During my studies, I spent a semester each at the Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan (2015/16), and at the NLP Lab of the 
            National University of Singapore (2018). In addition, I also spent one semester in China helping children to learn English while improving my Chinese (2017).
